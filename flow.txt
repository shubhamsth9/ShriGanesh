Do you have a million side projects that you left unfinished? Do you procrastinate on things that you started at 2am with great motivation? Is your side hustle still doing 0 dollars in revenue?
Did you remember Lord Ganesha before doing a git init? That's the reason you give up at the slightest of hindrance, what's the solution you ask? 
bringing to you, the shri ganesh extension. so.. whenever we start something in the real world, real is not really a correct word, i meant physical, in physical world, we pray to lord ganesha before starting something new like opening a new business, starting a new venture, buying a new house, car you get the idea, buttt we do not really have a similar ritual for things we start online, for our side projects, for web apps or software that we build using our computer for the virtual world that is the internet. 
there fore to invoke lord ganesha and seek his blessing before doing git init of a new idea that you have, i have built this extension,
what does it do? in terms of utility, nothing really per se. its a sort of ritual that you can perform virtually its a way to symbolically do a Shri Ganesh for virtual shubhaarambh

and the best part about it is thst its live on chrome web store
