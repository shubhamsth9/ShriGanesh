# Shri Ganeshaya Namah [श्री गणेशाय नम:]

## The phrase ‘Shri Ganesh’ signifies the start of something, especially the start of something good and positive. 
#### Lord Ganesh is one of the most loved Gods in Hinduism. In most of the households, a new task begins with the worship of Lord Ganesh. His name has become synonymous with beginnings and people often say ‘Shree Ganesh Karen’ in Hindi which means ‘Let’s Start’.  He is also called the ‘Vighnaharta’ or the remover of all obstacles. People believe that praying to him before starting a new task will remove all the barriers that might prevent the successful completion of the task.
##### It is the benevolent presence of Lord Ganesh that people fervently invoke at the beginning of a significant event—a new business venture, a birthday, an anniversary, a move into a new house, a wedding—when setting off to work or embarking on a journey. To beseech Lord Ganesh for his blessings is to ensure that the day, the event, the ritual is infused with positive energy, is free of obstacles, and arrives at a smooth and successful conclusion.
